      title: 'General',
      description: `These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our Website ("Services"). By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Any paid design/development work is governed by a separate master services agreement, statement of work, or similar contract between you and SoftKerr; in case of conflict, such signed agreement prevails over these Terms.

Please read these Terms carefully. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use our Services through our Website.

The collection and use of personal data in connection with the Website are governed by our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy (together, the “Privacy Documents”). These Terms do not modify your rights or our obligations under the Privacy Documents. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Documents regarding the processing of personal data, the Privacy Documents shall prevail. Links to the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy are provided on the Website, and you may manage your cookie choices at any time via the “Manage cookies” control.`,

      title: 'Eligibility',
      description: `You must be at least 18 years of age to use our Services, unless you are between the ages of 14 and 18 (or the age of majority established by law in the user's jurisdiction) and are under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who has agreed to these Terms. Individuals under the age of 14 are prohibited from requesting our Services. By accessing or using our Services, you represent and warrant that you meet the above requirements and are capable of entering into a legally binding agreement.

Where a higher minimum age is required by applicable law (including the age of majority or the “digital consent” age for information society services in your country), that higher age applies. In the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, if you are below the applicable digital consent age (which ranges from 13 to 16 depending on the country), any consent required for cookies, analytics, advertising, or similar processing must be provided or authorized by your parent or legal guardian. In the United States, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (COPPA). We may request and verify parental/guardian consent and may refuse, suspend, or terminate access if appropriate consent/authority is not provided or if age is misrepresented. If you are a parent or legal guardian who permits a minor to use the Services, you agree to be responsible for the minor’s activity and compliance with these Terms.`,
